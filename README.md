# Robotic_Easel
This project was made by a student's team to allow a quadraplegic person to paint with its mouth. It features a vocal command based on DeepSpeech, 4 proximity sensors to prevent the motors from pushing the structure out of its boundaries, and 2 motors to move a canvas along a vertical and an horizontal axis.

With simple vocal commands such as "move to right", the user is able to control a 2-axis table.


## Hardware requirements :
- 1 Raspberry Pi 4B
- 1 Arduino MEGA 2560
- 1 Microphone
- 4 Proximity sensors (VL53L0X for instance)
- 1 Power supply (24V preferred)
- 2 DC motors
- 2 drivers

## Software requirements :

- Deepspeech installed on the Raspberry Pi (current latest version is 0.9.3)
