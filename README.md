# Robotic_Easel
This project was made by students to allow a quadraplegic person to paint with its mouth. It features a vocal command based on DeepSpeech, 4 proximity sensors to prevent the motors from pushing the structure out of its boundaries, and 2 motors to move a canvas along a vertical and an horizontal axis.
